## Description

`nordic-e2e-toolkit` is a complete collection of modules required for e2e testing of typical frontend applications.
 It does not offer any special helpers or configurations, the only benefit that it has is to facilitate the installation
 and distribution of e2e related things.

It is based on the [Webdriver.io v7](https://webdriver.io/) test runner and uses the [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/api/) testing framework.

## Usage

### Install
```
npm install -D nordic-e2e-toolkit@1.0.0-wdio7-cucumber
```

### Configure

Create a configuration file following instructions that can be found in an [official documentation](https://webdriver.io/docs/options.html) or just use [wdio.conf.js](./wdio.conf.js) as a reference.

### Write tests

Since the current toolkit is based on Cucumber framework, at first describe your [step definitions](https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/step-definitions/) and then prepare the real tests by writing features using the [Gherkin syntax](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/).

In the `examples` folder you may find examples of [step definitions](./examples/tests/e2e/features/step_definitions/common.js) and [test features](./examples/tests/e2e/features/SamplePage.feature).

### Test your app

1) Run your application. The `start` script normally described in your `package.json` but if not just run the app using node directly:

```
node index.js
```

2) Run e2e tests with Webdriver.io tests runner:

```
./node_mobules/.bin/wdio wdio.conf.js
```

## Tests
```npm
npm test
```
