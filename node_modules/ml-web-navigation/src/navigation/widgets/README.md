# Widgets

In this folder, you can find all the different components that are rendered client side, and that need js on the frontend to allow customers to interact
with them.

## Behavior
The idea behind this component and the scaffolding that it follows, is to:
- Quickly know which frontend widgets we currently have, by quickly entering the folder widgets and read the different folders
- Each component has the responsibility to:
  - Include the src to the frontend js that will render the component and allow interactions
  - Also includes specific callbacks to initialize the component on the client side
  - It also follows the same approach as the other frontend components that we have, using a `props.js` file that is in charge of transforming and acquiring from the frontend-layout props only the necessary props needed for the component. More of that [here](/src/navigation/)

## Deploy static JS versions by config
The versions of the static widgets can be modified by [marketplace config](https://github.com/mercadolibre/fury_ml-navigation-config/blob/master/config/config.json#L11):
- Categories (categoriesVersion)
- Modal (modalVersion)
- Modeless Box (modelessBoxVersion)
- Searchbox (searchBoxVersion)
- Snackbar (snackbarVersion)
- User Menu (userMenuVersion)
- Onboarding CP (onBoardingCPVersion)

## Deploy static JS versions by header
Also the versions of the widget can be modified by this header `x-navigation-features` or for test `x-navigation-features-test` like this example:
`x-navigation-features`: `modalVersion=1.0.6;categoriesVersion=1.4.1;userMenuVersion=1.5.5;searchBoxVersion=2.7.0;snackbarVersion=1.0.1;`

> **NOTE**: The order of priority of versios is like this: first the header `x-navigation-features-test` (only for testing) then [marketplace config](https://github.com/mercadolibre/fury_ml-navigation-config/blob/master/config/config.json#L11) and last the header `x-navigation-features` that should be deprected when every Header is migrated to last version
