## Categories
### Integration
This widget works directly on the client side and enables the categories dropdown. This widget is 100% cliend side, so it does not do any API calls on the backend, and does all that retrieval from the client side. 

### Behavior
This widget displays information only on desktop and in `plus` navigation, and only if the categories link is present. There are some countries that do not show this widget, since the link is not present on `frontend-config`

When the menu is displayed, it shows like this:
<img width="874" alt="Screen Shot 2019-08-26 at 9 34 19 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13719066/63691504-c353d480-c7e5-11e9-9ea1-b2e0c2993a77.png">

If there is any error whatsoever with the javascript, the link always redirect to the categories landing page.
