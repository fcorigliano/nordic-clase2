## User Menu
### Integration
This widget works directly on the client side and enables the user menu dropdown. This widget is 100% cliend side, so it does not do any API calls on the backend, and does all that retrieval from the client side. 

### Behavior
This widget displays information only on desktop and in `plus` navigation, and only if the user menu link is present. 

When the menu is displayed, it shows like this:


If there is any error whatsoever with the javascript, the link always redirect to the user menu page.
