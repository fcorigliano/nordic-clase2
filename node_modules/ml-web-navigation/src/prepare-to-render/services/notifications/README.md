## Notifications
### Integration
The Notifications service retrieves the amount of notifications that a specific user has, in order to display a badge with that number. It calls the following API: `/users/${user.id}/newsgroups_count?caller.id=${user.id}&access_token=${user.access_token}&marketplace=mercadolibre`

### Behavior
This API call is executed only when the user is logged in and the navigation type is not `hidden` or `clean`. Also, this API call is done for both desktop and mobile, but the data retrieved is only from web mobile since desktop also holds the markup for the mobile version. This is due to the fact that we want to be responsive, so if the user makes the screen smaller, it will show the notifications as well. The desktop notifications are retrieved client side, so that is what they are not queried here.

If the api is successful, it looks like this:

If there is an error, the notification is not displayed.
