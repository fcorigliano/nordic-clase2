## Cart
### Integration
This navigation queries the Cart service in order to retrieve the amount of items the customer has on their cart. Currently this integration is done via the [nav-cart](https://github.com/mercadolibre/frontend-layout_widgets/tree/master/mercadolibre/packages/cart) module.

Later on, we use this module in order to query a specific [service](/src/prepare-to-render/services/cart/index.js#L27), in order to retrieve the cart's information

### Behavior
This service is queried only for navigations that are currently in `plus` type, so only the navigations that are of type `plus` will depend on this service.

On success, the navigation will display the cart icon with the number on top of it:

If the cart service returns an error, the cart icon will still be displayed, but it will not show the amount of items you have in your cart:
