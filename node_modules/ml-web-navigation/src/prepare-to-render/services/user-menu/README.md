## User Menu
### Integration
The User Menu service retrieves the additional information of a user, to display the menu in web/mobile. It calls the following API: `/frontend/sites/${site}/menu/user`;

### Behavior
This API call is executed only when the user is logged in and the navigation type is `plus` or `lite`. Also, this API call is done for both desktop and mobile, but the data retrieved is only from web mobile since desktop also holds the markup for the mobile version. This is due to the fact that we want to be responsive, so if the user makes the screen smaller, it will show the menu as well. The desktop menu is retrieved client side, so that is what they are not queried here.

If the api is successful, it looks like this:

If there is an error, the user menu will be displayed, but it will show the logged out version.
