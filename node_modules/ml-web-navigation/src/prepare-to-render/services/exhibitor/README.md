## Exhibitor
### Integration
The navigation displays a specific section on the top right corner of the script on desktop which is called Exhibitor. In order to retrieve the necessary information to display that section, it calls the API `/frontend/sites/${site}/menu/exhibitors`, which returns the text and link to redirect when the user clicks on it.

### Behavior
This section shows only when the navigation is of type `plus` and we are in desktop.

If the request is successful, it will display the text with a specific link to redirect

If the API fails, it will render a blank space:
