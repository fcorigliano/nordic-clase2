## CP
### Integration
This navigation queries the CP service in order to obtain the message to display for the current logged in (or not logged in) customer for the delivery preferences section. This section lets to configure where they would like to have their items shipped to.

On an integration level, this service queries the API `/frontend/sites/${siteId}/menu/location` and returns the necessary text and cookie configuration to display to the customer their CP preferences and also maintain that preference during their session.

### Behavior
This service is only queried when the navigation type is `plus` and the feature `features.menuShippingLocation.isShippingLocation` is turned on.

If the API is successful, it will show the CP section in desktop and the CP banner in web/mobile
