## Download App
### Integration
For the Download App Banner initiative, this navigation calls a specific API (`/download-appi`), which returns a specific set of components that will be rendered on the page. This API controls what download app banner will be rendered, and returns a variety of different components that can be rendered on the page. Then, depending on what type of component it returns (`html`, `script`), frontend-navigations will determine [how the component will be rendered](/src/navigation/download-app/index.js)

If the API is successful, it will display one of the varieties of the Download app banner:

If the API fails, there is no specific default, it will not show the banner.
