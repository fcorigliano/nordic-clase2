/**
 * In terms of how Portal Inmobiliario applications are using this type now,

 * it is better to manage this `conversion` in a lower level (basically this file) and from
 * every other part of PI's navigation it will be considered as plus, following the lines
 * of ML and maintaining a coherence between modules.
