## How to contribute

If you see something that isn't right or you're in need of a new feature, please follow this steps to help to resolve it.
* **Create an Issue in the corresponding repository describing the issue**
* **Tell us about it with an email indicating its priority** (this is important since maybe the feature you need has a reason not to exist or maybe someone else is already working on it)
* **Create the PR related to it and notify us**

When you send the pull request, please **do so against the develop branch** and **don't forget to attach the related Issue in the description**.

If the repository is a monorepo (multiple modules in one repository), you'll find a CHANGELOG.md in the module directory, please update it following this format:
```
