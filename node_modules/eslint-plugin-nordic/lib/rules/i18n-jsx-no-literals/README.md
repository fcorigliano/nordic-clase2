# Prevent usage of string literals in JSX (nordic/i18n-jsx-no-literals)
Since our frontend applications are going to be released in several sites, we need to have our strings evaluated by our i18n function, in order to get the specific translation for the current site. This rule checks that, if there is a string used in a JSX element, the string cannot be printed directly, but it needs to be passed through the i18n.gettext function.

## Rule Details
The following patterns make the rule show an error:
```jsx
const button = <Button>Confirm</Button>;
const button = <Button>{'Confirm'}</Button>;
const button = (
    <Button>
        <div>Text</div>
        <p>Text</p>
    </Button>
);

```

The following patterns are **not** considered warnings:

```jsx
const button = <Button>{i18n.gettext('Confirm')}</Button>;
```

### Options
At the moment, we do not have any available options for this rule.

### FAQ
#### Why did we not use [react/jsx-no-literals](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/jsx-no-literals.md)
We have created a new eslint rule for this specific scenario, since the context of our Nordic applications is Mercado's Ecosystem, and in that ecosystem,
is crucial that we support several countries and several languages. Letting those string literals in our project without passing them through i18n can rise the costs
of deploying your features to new sites. Using react/jsx-no-literals provided a similar rule, but it was not specifically related to Nordic ecosystem. We want the developers
to see the eslint error, but also know how to fix it, so we have provided a more custom message to the rule, as well as a link to the frontend-i18n project, so they can
learn how to fix the error.

#### Exceptions
Some exceptions where this rule could be ignored are:
- If you are testing a specific component and in order to execute that test, you are passing as a child a literal string.
- If you are managing a specific component per site, where you have separate logic, behavior and texts for each one, and you are solving i18n in a different manner

To ignore the rule you can:
- Ignore the rule for the whole file, by adding the comment /* eslint-disable i18n-jsx-no-literals */ at the top of the file
- Ignore the rule for a specific line, by adding the comment // eslint-disable-next-line i18n-jsx-no-literals before the line that you want to ignore
