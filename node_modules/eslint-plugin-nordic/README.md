# Nordic eslint plugin

> ESLINT plugin that provides several linting rules that are specific for Nordic projects

## Project Context
The project was created in order to provide to our frontend developers helpful tips and rules that will aid their development, specifically with Nordic applications. The idea
is to generate a set of eslint rules that help with common issues and standards that are specific to a frontend application that runs using Nordic.

## Installation
```
npm install --save-dev eslint-plugin-nordic --registry http://registry.npm.ml.com/
```

# Rules
- [i18n-jsx-no-literals](https://github.com/mercadolibre/fury_frontend-eslint-plugin-nordic/tree/develop/lib/rules/i18n-jsx-no-literals): prevent the usage of string literals in JSX and checks if i18n.gettext is being used.

# Development notes

First of all, you need to install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Then, you need to be familiar with the scaffolding of this project and how we can create new rules. You can learn more about that [here](#project-scaffolding)

## FAQ
### Why are we building these rules using webpack? Aren't eslint rules executed on the server side?

Eslint by default expects that our rules are written in ECMASCRIPT 5 syntax, so we need to transpile our code. You can read more about it in the [eslint documentation for Specifying Parser Options](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#specifying-parser-options)

## Project scaffolding

The scaffolding for this project has the following convention:
- lib
    - rules: folder that contains all the rules for this plugin. Each rule has its own folder, with the name being the ID that will be used in the eslint config
        - [rule-id]: folder containing the rule itself. It needs to have:
            - An index.js file with the main export for that rule
            - A folder with tests. Each test file inside that folder needs to end with *.test.js
            - A README.md file with a specification of what the rule does
- index.js: file that exports all the rules in this plugin.

## Adding new rules
To add a new rule, you need to follow these steps:
- Create a new folder under lib/rules with the id of the rule
- Define what your rule wants to do, you can use the [AST explorer](http://astexplorer.net) to figure out how the code you want to check is parsed and build on top of that.
- Check how to create [eslint rules](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/working-with-rules) and the API that it needs to comply
- Create the rule and add tests that check the behavior
- Add the rule to the index.js file
